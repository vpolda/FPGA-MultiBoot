# FPGA_MultiBoot
A project focused on implementing multi-hardware configuration functionality on a Xilinx SOC.
Done on a Kria KV260 which features a UltraScale+ MPSoC ZU5EV.

# Requirements
## Design
 - Switch between at least two configurations
 - Use anything beside jtag programming via external PC

## Analysis
 - Record boot and load time and power consumption?
 - Relation to bit stream size?
 - Memory requirements

# Development

## PS Driven
### Crawl
Boot from memory

### Walk

### Run

## PL Driven (Hardware only)
### Crawl

### Walk
